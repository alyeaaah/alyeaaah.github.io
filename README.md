#  Finally you have found me!

Hi, Iâ€™m a System Engineer and Web Developer based in Indonesia. I live in Surabaya on weekdays. I love being minimal and creative.

I work as full-stack engineer. in Frontend I usually use Angular, React and also Next JS for SSR needs. In Backend, I usually use PHP with CodeIgniter framework or Javascript with Express JS Framework. In Mobile App Development I usually use hybrid frameworks like Ionic Capacitor or React Native Framework.
